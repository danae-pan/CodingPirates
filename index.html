    <h1>How Human Vision Works</h1>
    <p>
        When light hits an object, like a dog, it bounces off the object and travels into our eyes. The light first passes through
        a clear layer called the <strong>cornea</strong>, which helps focus it. Next, the light goes through the <strong>pupil</strong>, which
        controls how much light enters. The <strong>retina</strong> at the back of the eye then receives the light, where special
        sensors called <strong>rods</strong> and <strong>cones</strong> detect colors and shapes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our brain then works like a puzzle solver, turning the light into information about color, shape, movement, and detail,
        helping us understand what we're seeing!
    </p>

        This is how we can see but what about computers? Well, like we have eyes, computers have sensors
