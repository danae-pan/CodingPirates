    <h1>Color Detection</h1>
    <h2>Human Vision</h2>
    <p>
        When we see something, light from the object enters our eyes through a clear layer called the <strong>cornea</strong>.
        The cornea directs the light to the <strong>pupils</strong>, which control how much light gets in. The light then reaches
        the <strong>retina</strong> at the back of the eye, where special sensors called <strong>rods</strong> and <strong>cones</strong> detect colors and shapes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Seeing is like solving a puzzleâ€”our brain takes the light and turns it into information about color, shape, movement, 
        and details to help us understand what we're looking at.
