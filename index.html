                When light hits an object, like a dog, it bounces off the object and travels into our eyes. The light first
                passes through
                a clear layer called the <strong>cornea</strong>, which helps focus it. Next, the light goes through the
                <strong>pupil</strong>, which
                controls how much light enters. The <strong>retina</strong> at the back of the eye then receives the light,
                where special
                sensors called <strong>rods</strong> and <strong>cones</strong> detect colors and shapes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our brain then works like a puzzle solver, turning the light into information about color, shape, movement, and
                detail,
                helping us understand what we're seeing!

    <h2>How Computer Vision Works</h2>
    <p>
        This is how we can see but what about computers? Well, like we use our eyes, computers use <strong>digital
            cameras</strong> equipped with <strong>sensors</strong> to capture light.
        These sensors, usually CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semi-conductor) or sometimes CCD (Charge-Coupled Device),
        detect light (photons) and convert it into electrical
        signals (electrons).
    </p>
    <p>
        To reproduce human color vision, the acquisition mimics the three kinds of cones by using filtering in front of the
        sensor. One commonly used filter is the <strong>Bayer filter</strong>, 
        a mosaic of red, green, and blue filters, which is placed over a square grid of photosensors. Each filter acts like a colored lens,
        only allowing light of its corresponding wavelength to pass through while blocking the others. This means that each pixel 
        in the sensors detects only one color channel, e.g., a red pixel records the intensity of red light but knows nothing about the green 
        and blue light. But what can we do with this? How would we find the missing colors? Cameras come to rescue, using a process called demosaicing
        which estimates the missing color values for each pixel by analyzing the surrunding pixels. One simple approach to this is averaging neighboring pixels.
    </p>

    <p>Here is how it works in practice: </p>
   
    <div class="side-by-side">
        <div class="text-container">
            <p>
                In the following image, the highlighted red pixel has an intensity value of 100. To estimate the missing green
                and blue values for this pixel, we consider its neighboring pixels in a 3x3 grid:
            </p>
            <p>
                To calculate the <strong>green channel</strong>, we take the intensity values of the four surrounding green
                pixels and average them:
            </p>
            <p class="formula">
                Green value = (Green1 + Green2 + Green3 + Green4) / 4
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, to calculate the <strong>blue channel</strong>, we average the intensity values of the four
                surrounding blue pixels:
            </p>
            <p class="formula">
                Blue value = (Blue1 + Blue2 + Blue3 + Blue4) / 4
            </p>
            <p>
                This interpolation process ensures that each pixel now has values for <strong>Red</strong>,
                <strong>Green</strong>, and <strong>Blue</strong>,
                transforming the single-color pixel into a complete, colorful one.
