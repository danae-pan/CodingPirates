### Color Detection

#### Human Vision
When we see something, light from the object enters our eyes through a clear layer called the cornea. The cornea directs the light to the pupils, which control how much light gets in. The light then reaches the retina at the back of the eye, where special sensors called rods and cones detect colors and shapes.

Seeing is like solving a puzzleâ€”our brain takes the light and turns it into information about color, shape, movement, and details to help us understand what we're looking at.
